# Kickstarting with Excel  

## Overview of Project  
  
### Purpose

This project is about the Kickstarter campaigns and their outcomes since their launch dates. Each campaign has a goal to reach in order to be considered “successful”. The data shows the total amount pledged versus the total goals of each campaign. The purpose of this project is to analyze the data given for each campaign and determine the **Outcomes Based on Launch Date** and the **Outcomes Based on Goals**.  

## Analysis and Challenges  
  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The figure below shows the number of outcomes based on calendar month of the campaigns' launch dates. This data will help us identify and determine which calendar month has the most successful, failed, live, and canceled outcomes.

Let's analyze the data of the highest outcome based on Parent category which is **Theater**. There are 1369 total outcomes for Theater category excluding Live outcomes. 839 of which are successful outcomes, 493 total failed outcomes, and 37 total canceled outcomes. The data below shows the number of Theater outcomes based on their calendar month launch dates.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Let's also analyze the **Outcomes Based on Goals**. The chart below shows the percentage results of each outcome based on Goals. The goals are binned in increments of $4,999 (example: $1,000 to $4,999, $5,000 to $9,999).

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered  
Many of the challenges in this exercise were not related to the analysis of the data itself. But rather the "process" of formatting this document, linking images, and uploading to GitHub. As a new user, I am still in the process of learning how to navigate GitHub, how repositories work, and uploading files to that ecosystem.
  
## Results  
  
- I therefore conclude that the Month of May has the most successful launch and the Month of April has the lowest failed launch. Also, Theater category has the most successful launch compared to other categories. I also conclude that the month of May for Theater category has the most successful outcome launch, while the month of November has the lowest number of failed outcomes for Theater category.

- I therefore conclude that the campaigns with less than $1,000 goal has the highest successful outcomes based on percentage rate with a total of 76% success rate. While campaigns with goals ranging from $45,000 to $49,999 has a 100% failure rate.

- Some limitations to this dataset are related to donation/funding statistics other than "Average Donation". For example, did a campaign have a single large donation or many small donations? This will help indicate if a capaign was wildly populator with many donors or sustained by small group of benefactors with a large donation amount

- Other Possible tables / graphs that we could create are: 
	- A table/plot that shows the country with the most successful outcomes
	- A table/plot that is most relevant category for each country (This will help show what campains work best for that demographic)
